<h1>Quick Guide to Saladin</h1>

<p>The main window of Saladin consists of a tool strip for accessing commonly used <a href="functions.html">functions</a> and <a href="tools.html">tools</a> and two panels for working with directories. Each panel consists of a drive bar, location bar, <a href="lists.html">list of files</a> and status bar.</p>

<p>One of the panels is active and acts as the source panel for copy/move operations; the other panel is the target panel. You can clicking anywhere on a panel to activate it or press <b>Tab</b> to switch the active panel. The source and target panels can be distinguished by the color of the location bar.</p>

<p>The drive bar displays buttons representing all available hard disks and other drives connected to the computer. You can click on the drive button to open the root directory of the drive in the panel beneath it. You can also press <b>Alt+F1</b> or <b>Alt+F2</b> to select a drive using a drop down list in the right or left panel, respectively. Right click on the drive bar and select <b><img src="../icons/refresh-16.png" /> Refresh Drives</b> in case the bar doesn't refresh automatically when adding or removing a drive.</p>

<p>The location bar displays the path of the current directory or the name if it has no physical path. You can type the location of the directory in the location bar and press <b>Enter</b> to open it. Click on the location bar or press <b>Ctrl+O</b> to activate it. You can also select <b>Tools &gt; <img src="../icons/open-16.png" /> Open</b> (<b>Ctrl+Shift+O</b>) to browse for a directory.</p>

<p>The <a href="lists.html">file list</a> displays the contents of the current directory.</p>

<p>The status bar displays the number and total size of selected items and all items in the current directory. It also displays the name, capacity and amount of free space on the current drive.</p>
