Requirements
============

 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or newer

 * Qt framework, version 4.6 or newer (http://qt-project.org/)

The program can be built using the standard 'qmake' tool from Qt. Simple configure
script is available which creates a configuration file and runs qmake with
appropriate parameters.

Open the Visual Studio Command Prompt. Make sure that QTDIR is set to the path where
Qt was installed. Go to the directory where you have unpacked Saladin and run:

    > set QTDIR=C:\path\to\qt4
    > configure.bat
    > nmake

Additional options that can be passed to the configure script:

    -prefix DIR

        The location where the package will be installed (default is
        'C:\Program Files\Saladin').

    -debug

        Build with debugging symbols.

    -msvc

        Generate a solution for Microsoft Visual Studio instead of Makefiles.
